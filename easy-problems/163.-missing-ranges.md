# 163. Missing Ranges

> You are given an inclusive range `[lower, upper]` and a **sorted unique** integer array `nums`, where all elements are within the inclusive range.
>
> A number `x` is considered **missing** if `x` is in the range `[lower, upper]` and `x` is not in `nums`.
>
> Return _the **shortest sorted** list of ranges that exactly covers all the missing numbers_. That is, no element of `nums` is included in any of the ranges, and each missing number is covered by one of the ranges.
>
>
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```
> Input: nums = [0,1,3,50,75], lower = 0, upper = 99
> Output: [[2,2],[4,49],[51,74],[76,99]]
> Explanation: The ranges are:
> [2,2]
> [4,49]
> [51,74]
> [76,99]
> ```

#### Solution:

Another tough description. Let's break it down: we've got an array of integers and another pair of integers denoting a lower and upper bound. Any number between these two bounds is considered missing if it isn't also found in the nums array. We need to put together the smallest possible list of ranges (which are simply collections of an upper and lower bound) which includes every missing number, and _only_ missing numbers. \
\
Looking at the example we can piece together a simple pattern: we start from the lower bound and move forward step by step. Whenever we encounter a jump of more than 1 between any consecutive pair of numbers, we place all the in-between values in their own range. \
\
And that's about it! What's left is turning that idea into code:&#x20;

* let's start by initializing our range list:

```java
List<List<Integer> ranges = new ArrayList<>();
```

* _edge case alert!_ our input array can be of length 0, so we need to account for that:

```java
if (nums.length == 0) {
    ranges.add(Arrays.asList(lower, upper));
    return ranges;
}
```

* let's also account for the possibility that the lower bound might be lower than our lowest number:

```java
if (nums[0] > lower) 
    ranges.add(Arrays.asList(lower, nums[0]-1));
```

* now we check the difference between every pair of consecutive numbers and add the respective range to our list every time we find a gap:&#x20;

```java
for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) 
    if (nums[i] - nums[i-1] > 1) 
        ranges.add(Arrays.asList(nums[i-1]+1, nums[i]-1));
```

* one more check for the final pair:

```java
if (upper > nums[nums.length-1]) 
    ranges.add(Arrays.asList(nums[nums.length-1]+1, upper));
```

Here's the final result:

```java
public List<List<Integer>> findMissingRanges(int[] nums, int lower, int upper) {
    List<List<Integer>> ranges = new ArrayList<>();

    if (nums.length == 0) {
        ranges.add(Arrays.asList(lower, upper));
        return ranges;
    }

    if (nums[0] > lower) 
        ranges.add(Arrays.asList(lower, nums[0]-1));

    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) 
        if (nums[i] - nums[i-1] > 1) 
            ranges.add(Arrays.asList(nums[i-1]+1, nums[i]-1));

    if (upper > nums[nums.length-1]) 
        ranges.add(Arrays.asList(nums[nums.length-1]+1, upper));

    return ranges;
}
```
